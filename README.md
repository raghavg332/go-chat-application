# C++ Multi-Threaded Chat Application

A high-performance, terminal-based chat system built in modern C++ with **POSIX sockets** and **ncurses**.  
Supports **multi-client messaging**, **group chat**, and a simple command interface — engineered for concurrency, stability, and real-time feedback.

## Features

### 🖥 Server
- **Multi-threaded TCP server** with one thread per client.
- **Group chat support** (`/join <group>`, `/leave`, `/groups`).
- **Global chat mode** for broadcasting to all connected users.
- **User list** command (`/users`) to view participants in real-time.
- **Thread-safe state management** with `std::mutex` to prevent race conditions.
- **Graceful client disconnect handling**.

### 💬 Client
- **Ncurses-based UI** with split chat & input windows.
- **Color-coded messages**:
  - Your messages in **cyan**.
  - Incoming user names/prefixes in **red**.
  - System/global messages in **green**.
- **Responsive input box** with prompt.
- **Ctrl+C safe exit** — cleans up sockets and UI.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++17
- **Libraries:** `pthread`, `ncurses`
- **Protocols:** TCP (IPv4)
- **Platform:** POSIX-compliant systems (Linux, macOS)
- **Build:** `g++` with `-pthread -lncurses`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Compile
```bash
cd server
g++ main.cpp -o main -pthread
cd client
g++ main.cpp -o main -pthread -lncurses
```

### 2. Run the server
```bash
cd server
./main
```
By default, the server listens on **port 8081**.

### 3. Run clients
```bash
cd client
./main
```
Enter a username when prompted, then chat using:
- `/users` — List connected users
- `/join <group>` — Create/join a group
- `/groups` — List available groups
- `/leave` — Leave current group

## 📊 Performance Benchmark

All benchmarks were run on:
- **AWS EC2 Free Tier** (t2.micro — 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM)
- **Amazon Linux (latest)**
- Server compiled with `g++` on Amazon Linux
- Clients simulated using the provided async load tester (`load_tester.py`), measuring **Time-to-First-Byte (TTFB)** for `/users` command responses.
- Clients and server ran on different instances.

### **Baseline Run** — 100 concurrent clients

**Peak stable concurrency (per criteria):** **400 concurrent clients** before median TTFB exceeded acceptable latency threshold.

## 📈 Key Takeaways
- Handles **100 concurrent clients** with **p50 latency ~53 ms** on a remote **t2.micro** instance.
- Scales to **400 concurrent clients** before significant median latency growth (>160 ms).
- Zero connection failures observed up to 450 concurrent clients in this environment.
- Memory & CPU remained stable during testing; main bottleneck is **single-thread-per-client model** on limited CPU.
